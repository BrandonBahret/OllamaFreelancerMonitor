# Task Analysis Process

## **Project Introduction**

Freelancer.com currently requires users to spend extended periods reviewing numerous job listings. Due to the high level of competition, it is often necessary to evaluate many opportunities to identify those that best align with a worker’s skills. This process can lead to significant time spent reading job descriptions without a guarantee of securing work, especially when the selection of proposals can be arbitrary.

The objective of this project is to automate the review process by continuously filtering incoming job listings and recommending those that are most relevant. By doing so, the system aims to reduce time wasted on unsuitable listings and increase the likelihood of submitting compelling proposals that lead to successful hires.

### Objective

Our intent is to develop a structured and systematic process for analyzing task-worker compatibility by defining clear, measurable criteria. We will quantify the most critical aspects of this assessment and establish standardized guidelines for each point in the process. The system will take as inputs a worker’s personal statement of interests, past works, and a client’s detailed task description. From these inputs, we will generate two key metrics—a **Compatibility Score**, evaluating the alignment of skills and experience with task requirements, and an **Interest Score**, assessing the worker’s potential enthusiasm and long-term fit. This framework will ensure objectively grounded decision-making in task recommendations.

### Introduction

Below is a structured framework to systemize the analysis of task–worker compatibility. This framework defines two scores—a **Compatibility Score** and an **Interest Score**—using inputs from a worker’s personal statement (covering interests and past work) and a detailed task description. In addition, clear instructions are provided for each role involved in the pipeline.

## 1. Overview of the Pipeline

**Inputs:**

- **Worker Input:**
    - **Personal Statement of Interests:** Narrative that includes expressed passions, career goals, and subject-matter affinities.
    - **Past Works:** Portfolio, resume, or work samples that demonstrate skills, experiences, and outcomes.
- **Task Input:**
    - **Task Description:** Document detailing required technical skills, responsibilities, expected deliverables, timelines, and work environment aspects.

**Outputs:**

- **Compatibility Score:** A composite metric indicating how well the worker’s skills, experiences, and work style match the task requirements.
- **Interest Score:** A metric reflecting how strongly the worker’s stated interests and career aspirations align with the subject matter and goals of the task.

## 2. Defining Key Metrics and Their Weightings

You can break down the two scores into subcomponents, each rated on a standardized scale (e.g., 1 to 10). Adjust weights based on what your organization deems most crucial.

### **A. Compatibility Score**

*Measures how well the worker’s capabilities align with the task’s requirements.*

**Sub-Metrics:**

1. **Technical Skills Fit (Weight: e.g., 40%)**
    - **Definition:** How closely do the worker’s technical skills match the task’s technical requirements?
    - **Instruction:** Evaluate past work samples and certifications against the task’s listed tools, languages, or methodologies. Do they possess the depth required for the task?
2. **Experience Relevance (Weight: e.g., 30%)**
    - **Definition:** How well does the worker’s past experience (projects, roles) match the complexity and domain of the task?
    - **Instruction:** Compare previous projects or roles that are similar in scope or industry / domain (software development, writing, design, mathematics, art, music.)

**Calculation:**

Compatibility Score=(Skill Score×0.4)+(Experience Score×0.6)

### **B. Interest Score**

*Measures how well the worker’s personal interests and passions align with the task’s subject matter and broader objectives.*

**Sub-Metrics:**

1. **Subject Matter Interest (Weight: e.g., 60%)**
    - **Definition:** To what extent does the worker’s personal statement reflect enthusiasm or prior involvement in the domain of the task?
    - **Instruction:** Use keyword matching, tone analysis, and contextual review to rate the expressed interest in relevant topics.
2. **Career and Growth Alignment (Weight: e.g., 30%)**
    - **Definition:** How well does the task fit into the worker’s long-term career aspirations or areas of desired growth?
    - **Instruction:** Look for statements about career goals and compare them to the opportunities and challenges described in the task.
3. **Commitment and Passion (Weight: e.g., 10%)**
    - **Definition:** Does the worker’s narrative demonstrate a genuine passion or commitment that suggests they would go above and beyond?
    - **Instruction:** Assess tone, personal anecdotes, and expressed dedication.

**Calculation:**

Interest Score=(Subject Interest Score×0.6)+(Career Alignment Score×0.3)+(Commitment Score×0.1)\text{Interest Score} = (Subject\ Interest\ Score \times 0.6) + (Career\ Alignment\ Score \times 0.3) + (Commitment\ Score \times 0.1)

## 3. Process Roles and Instructions

### **A. Worker (Candidate)**

- **Instruction:**
    - Prepare a comprehensive personal statement that outlines your interests, career objectives, and why you are passionate about the subject matter.
    - Include a portfolio or detailed record of past works that highlight skills and experiences related to the task.
    - Ensure clarity in the description of your work style and any specific tools or technologies you are familiar with.

### **B. Task Owner/Manager**

- **Instruction:**
    - Provide a clear, detailed task description including required technical skills, expected deliverables, deadlines, work environment, and any specific process expectations.
    - Specify key deliverables and any unique attributes that define the task’s complexity or culture.
    - Highlight which aspects (technical, experiential, or personal alignment) are most critical for success.

### **C. Evaluator/Analyst**

- **Instruction:**
    - **Data Extraction:** Use structured templates or NLP tools to extract relevant data from the candidate’s personal statement and past works, and from the task description.
    - **Metric Assignment:**
        - Rate each sub-metric (technical skills, experience relevance, work style, etc.) on a standardized scale (e.g., 1–10).
        - Provide guidelines or scoring rubrics to ensure consistency across evaluations.
    - **Scoring Calculation:**
        - Apply the weighted formulae to calculate the overall Compatibility and Interest Scores.
        - Document the scores for each sub-metric along with justifications for the ratings.
    - **Feedback:**
        - Provide feedback to the candidate if applicable, detailing areas of strong alignment and areas for improvement.
        - Use the scoring breakdown to support decisions on task assignments or further interviews/training needs.

## 4. Final Decision and Use of Scores

- **Decision Making:**
    - Use the Compatibility Score as an indicator of whether the worker’s skills and experiences are a good match for the task’s technical and operational requirements.
    - Use the Interest Score to gauge the worker’s potential motivation and long-term engagement with the project.
    - Establish threshold scores (e.g., a minimum compatibility score of 7/10 and an interest score of 6/10) to guide decision-making or to trigger follow-up interviews or assessments.
- **Documentation:**
    - Maintain detailed records of each evaluation to support transparent decision-making and to facilitate continuous improvement in the scoring process.
