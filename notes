# Task Analysis Notes

**Project Introduction**

Freelancer.com currently requires users to spend extended periods reviewing numerous job listings. Due to the high level of competition, it is often necessary to evaluate many opportunities to identify those that best align with a user’s skills. This process can lead to significant time spent reading job descriptions without a guarantee of securing work, especially when the selection of proposals appears arbitrary.

The objective of this project is to automate the review process by continuously filtering incoming job listings and recommending those that are most relevant. By doing so, the system aims to reduce time wasted on unsuitable listings and increase the likelihood of submitting compelling proposals that lead to successful hires

# Directional Document for Job Analysis and Recommendation Project

## I. Introduction

This document provides a roadmap for the next phase of development in our job analysis and recommendation project. The goal is to create a modular, multi-stage pipeline that can extract, analyze, and compare job requirements with personal skills and experiences. By doing so, the system will not only assess compatibility but also provide insights into potential skill gaps and resources for further learning.

- **Personal Growth and Portfolio Enhancement:**
    
    By quantifying the compatibility between job requirements and personal skills, the project aims to highlight areas for improvement and recommend targeted learning resources. This ensures continuous skill development and portfolio enhancement.
    
- **Automated, Evolving Skill Repository:**
    
    Create a persistently evolving model that not only captures historical personal data but also dynamically adapts to new job market trends, serving as a repository of skills and experience assessments.
    

### B. Intent Summary

- **Holistic Analysis:**
    
    Analyze job descriptions to extract key features and align them with a personal summary to assess compatibility and identify gaps.
    
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline:**
    
    Utilize a multi-stage analysis pipeline to break down the process into manageable, modular steps. This ensures that each aspect—from summarization to risk assessment—is given detailed attention.
    
- **Actionable Recommendations:**
    
    Generate insights such as skill gap reports, learning resource recommendations, and compatibility metrics that empower users to proactively address identified gaps.

Modules

A module that generates embeddings for words and computes similarity scores. 

Create a benchmark to assess the reliability for the analyzer. Collect several job descriptions and manually extract and assess compatibility etc. Then run the analyzer on each test case and compare results.

## III. Job Descriptions

### Features to Extract from the Job Description

1. **Deliverables:**
    - List the expected outcomes and deliverables.
2. **Project Complexity:**
    - Decompose the project into its constituent components.
    - Identify how many skills and disciplines are required to complete the task.
3. **Required Tools & Skills:**
    - Define the necessary tools, skill sets, and domains.
    - Assess how much abstract reasoning or creativity is needed for each skill.
4. **Skill Proficiency Level:**
    - Evaluate the required level of proficiency and depth of experience.
    - Determine how advanced the training or proficiency needs to be.
5. **Language Detection:**
    - Automatically detect the language of the job description.

## IV. Personal Statements

Personal statements should provide an overview of your past work experience, the skills and tools you have used, and your level of proficiency in each. They should evaluate whether you meet the necessary qualifications for specific tasks and ensure alignment with required skills and tool expertise. This self-assessment serves as a reflection of your capabilities and compatibility for various roles or projects.

### Features to Determine from the Personal Statement

1. **Portfolio & Skill Enhancement:**
    - Assess how the project can enhance personal skills or add value to your portfolio.
2. **Personal Summary Analysis:**
    - Compare your personal summary (skills, past work, tool proficiency) against job requirements.
    - Evaluate talent compliance and overall compatibility.
3. **Persistent Skill Repository:**
    - Maintain an evolving model of personal skills that maps out interconnectivity and development over time.
4. **Compatibility & Gap Analysis:**
    - Measure the alignment between job demands and personal capabilities.
    - Identify and log skill gaps, including estimates of their depth.
5. **Resource Recommendations:**
    - Generate brief recommendations on how to bridge identified skill gaps.
    - Provide targeted resources and insights to support learning needs.

## V. Architectural Considerations: Modular Pipeline

Structure your analysis pipeline so that each stage (data ingestion, preprocessing, multi-stage analysis, and post-processing) remains modular. This design makes it easier to iterate on or upgrade individual components without overhauling the entire system.

### A. Modular Pipeline Structure

- **Data Ingestion:**
    
    Collect job descriptions and personal summaries.
    
- **Preprocessing:**
    
    Clean and structure the raw data.
    
- **Multi-Stage Analysis:**
    
    Break down the evaluation into discrete, manageable stages.
    
- **Post-Processing & Validation:**
    
    Aggregate results and ensure consistency through validation checks.
    

### B. Ensemble Techniques

- **Multiple Analysis Runs:**
    
    Execute several analyses with slight variations in prompts.
    
- **Aggregation/Averaging:**
    
    Combine or average outputs to reduce randomness and improve reliability.

## VI. Personal Skills Model and Skill Gap Analysis

### 1. Persistent and Evolving Personal Skills Model

Develop a dynamic, continuously evolving model that captures and updates a comprehensive profile of personal skills over time. This model will autonomously refine itself based on past work, newly acquired skills, and recurring themes from job descriptions. It will also serve as a structured repository detailing relationships, dependencies, and contextual applications of skills across various industries and tasks.

### 2. Job Compatibility Assessment

Evaluate job compatibility by comparing required tools, knowledge areas, and expertise levels with personal abilities. This structured assessment will include:

- **Skill Alignment:**
    
    Assess the degree to which personal skills match job requirements.
    
- **Skill Gaps:**
    
    Identify missing competencies and measure the depth of these gaps to determine the feasibility of bridging them.
    
- **Growth Potential:**
    
    Understand whether certain gaps represent opportunities for valuable skill development.
    

### 3. Skill Gap Tracking and Learning Recommendations

Beyond identifying gaps, track them over time and provide actionable reports that include:

- **Personalized Learning Recommendations:**
    
    Generate engaging blurbs on relevant topics, explaining their significance and connection to personal interests.
    
- **Resource Curation:**
    
    Suggest targeted learning materials—such as books, courses, articles, or hands-on projects—to facilitate skill acquisition.
    
- **Interest-Based Exploration:**
    
    Highlight emerging skills and trends that align with long-term personal and professional goals, fostering continuous learning and growth.
    

This approach ensures that tasks not only align with current abilities but also serve as catalysts for meaningful skill development and career progression.
