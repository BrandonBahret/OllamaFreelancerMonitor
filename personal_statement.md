My passion for software development began unexpectedly in high school during a precalculus class. A module on programming the TI-83 calculator shattered my assumptions about coding -- what once seemed like an arcane skill reserved for experts turned out to be an exercise in logic and problem-solving. I was hooked. What started as a classroom assignment quickly became an obsession, and I spent hundreds of hours experimenting with TI-BASIC, building my first projects on that tiny screen. Though those early creations are long gone, that experience ignited a lifelong love for programming -- one that has driven me ever since.

The first language I learned was Python, and I immediately started exploring different aspects of programming. I tinkered with Arduino, built small C modules using the Windows API, and even created automation scripts for video games like Breakout and Tetris. My curiosity led me to experiment with Android development, where I recreated existing apps to understand their inner workings before developing my own task-tracking app, which I still use today. I also dabbled in web development, designing simple pages, informers, games, and basic web applications. While I haven't held a traditional professional role, I've done light freelancing and data entry work, further developing my ability to structure projects and organize data efficiently.

One of the projects I'm most proud of is an AI-driven Tetris automation program—built entirely through procedural logic, with no machine learning involved. The challenge began with extracting real-time game data using the Windows API and OpenCV, which introduced me to the complexities of computer vision. I had to break the game state down into structured data, analyzing board conditions frame by frame to develop an optimization algorithm for clearing lines efficiently. At first, I experimented with a genetic algorithm to refine decision-making, but I found it too unpredictable for my needs. Instead, I engineered a heuristic-based system that prioritized urgency, minimizing board bumpiness and avoiding gaps. Debugging was an intense process—hours spent fine-tuning image segmentation masks, tracking moving pieces, and ensuring the AI reacted dynamically to changing conditions. But when everything finally clicked, and I watched the AI play with great efficiency, the sense of accomplishment was incredible.

I've always enjoyed experimenting with different technologies and APIs, mostly driven by curiosity or a desire to solve small, interesting problems. For example, I spent some time diving into web scraping and text processing with Ollama, learning the nuances of data extraction and working with external APIs. These projects weren't massive in scale, but each one helped me refine my skills and approach to problem-solving.

Another project that stands out is a tool I built to analyze my typing habits, sparked by a desire to optimize my office setup. As someone who enjoys gaming and values ergonomic design, I found using a full-size keyboard cumbersome, especially when space is tight. I wanted to determine the ideal keyboard size for my workflow, so I developed a keystroke frequency tracker and visualized the data in a heatmap. This project merged my passion for data-driven solutions and practical problem-solving, revealing which keys I used most frequently. I quickly realized that while I could sacrifice the numpad, I relied heavily on the arrow keys and function rows. This insight led me to conclude that a 75% or 80% keyboard layout was optimal, balancing ergonomics with efficiency.

One of the more fun projects I worked on was developing a tool that interfaced with the Valorant API. My aim was to better understand player experiences and match outcomes, focusing on common myths circulating in the gaming community -- specifically, the prevalence of "smurfs" and cheaters. To do this, I analyzed match data, dug into player performance metrics, and sought to challenge perceptions about the game. I investigated factors like time of day, party size, and player behavior to see how they influenced match results. Ultimately, this project allowed me to combine technical skills with a deep curiosity about player behavior, aiming to provide more accurate insights into how game outcomes are shaped by performance and player habits, rather than relying on popular wisdom alone.

Alongside these projects, I built a handful of Python utilities to help manage API calls more efficiently. I focused on caching results and controlling quota usage, which saved me a lot of headaches when working with data that was limited by request frequency. Another project I'm particularly proud of is JsonInjest. It's a tool I created to help parse complex JSON objects, leveraging Lark to streamline that process. Each of these projects, while minor in scope, allowed me to explore different challenges and refine my problem-solving approach. Each were valuable stepping stones in my development journey.

Right now, I find myself at a crossroads in defining my exact career path. Python remains my strongest language, but I've found that picking up new syntaxes comes naturally to me. I excel at structuring data in ways that make algorithm development more intuitive, and I have a keen eye for optimization -- whether it's eliminating redundancies in code or refining UI layouts for better usability. My experience with Figma has been instrumental in designing interfaces, allowing me to wireframe, prototype, and experiment with color selection, typography, and page organization. At different times, I've envisioned myself as an Android developer, a backend engineer, or a web developer. What I do know is that I thrive in challenging, algorithmic problem spaces and that I want my work to have a positive impact -- whether it's in educational software, productivity tools, or something entirely unexpected. I have decided I do not want to work in game development, however, that is for certain. More than anything, I'm eager to learn, grow, and refine my focus with the right mentorship and opportunities.

What sets me apart is my deep commitment to learning and problem-solving. I take pride in making things the right way. When I encounter a challenge, I dive in fully, exhaust all resources, and refine my approach until I find the best possible solution. Whether it's through watching conference talks or watching lectures I ensure that I am well-rounded and prepared for the task at hand. My aim is always to deliver solutions that are not only functional but also well-crafted, with attention to detail and a focus on long-term effectiveness.

My journey so far has been fueled by curiosity and a drive to build. I look forward to finding the right environment where I can channel that energy into meaningful contributions.
